## Introduction

Emmerlaus is a game of cards and dice designed in Quebec. In this game, you play a wizard who faces opponents in magical combat. This game appeals to both fans of role-playing and strategy games.

This document is an edited version of the one found on http://www.creationschaos.com.

## Basics

The game includes cards and special dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20.

Cards are your items and spells in the imaginary realm of the game. Each player draws cards to build his starting hand.

The game is played clockwise. Each player plays one card at his turn unless game situations allow otherwise. Also, some cards can come into play and at the beginning of your next turn, can be activated in addition to the card that would normally be played. However most cards are played and then thrown to the Talon (the discard pile) once their effect is completed.

## Objective

Each player starts the game with 50 Hit Points. A player is eliminated when his Hit Points reach 0 or less. When a player has eliminated all his rivals, or when there is only players from one team (for team games), the game ends.

## Card categories

The cards are divided into different categories that are recognizable by their background color. You can obtain a card's description in two ways: by placing your cursor over the card or clicking on it. The latter will also make the description appear in the newswire (text zone that describes the game action).

### Attack Damage (AD) - orange
These cards reduce the Hit Points of an opponent and may even cause his instant removal in some cases.

### Attribute (A) - blue-green
These cards increase your Hit Points or those of a teammate.

### Mass Attack (MA) - night sky
These cards reduce the Hit Points of all opponents and can even cause their instant removal in some cases.

### Object (O) - brown
These cards are put into play and remain in place until they are stolen or destroyed by an opponent. There are several kinds of objects: Rings, Staffs, Hats, Belts, Robes and Amulets. It is only possible to have (wear) one object of each type at once, except for Rings where it is possible to have two at a time. An object can be replaced by another, the former will be thrown to the Talon.

### Counter Object (CO) - burgundy and white
These cards allow you to steal or destroy objects of an opponent.

### Spécial (S) - silver
These cards have various effects, such as increasing the effectiveness of your attacks or making you temporarily invincible. Some are played and remain in play, others are played and then discarded to the Talon.

### Spell (SP) - black
These cards are used to penalize an opponent, for instance they may lower his defense or reduce his number of cards in hand. Their effect is permanent, unless the opponent plays 2 Cancellations card to get rid of them.

### Allies (AL) - black and white
These cards are special characters you can bring into play. You can control them as you do with your main character. Allies get their own Hit Points and cards. They all have a special skill.

### Strategic (ST) - yellow and gray
These cards once played allow you to play a second card of another class, the second card will be more difficult for the opponent to defend against. The Double Speed card allows you to play two more cards.

### Counterattack (C-A or CA) - purple
These cards are played during the opponent's turn. They increase your chances of evading his attacks. Or, they can cancel a given spell or reflect that spell back at him. Cancellation cards can exceptionally be played during your turn to remove a spell (SP) that affects you or a special card (S) your opponent is using to give himself an advantage.

### Emmerlaüs (E) - gold
These cards have various effects. They are among the most powerful in the game.

## Games turns

A typical turn is played as follow:

    The player's turn is announced
    All effects in play with a duration have a counter decrease
    If the player has objects or spells that can be activated at the beginning of his turn, he can use them at this point
    He plays his main card
    All effects expiring at the end of this turn are sent to the Talon
    The player draws all missing cards

The player is guided through these steps. If he controls other characters in addition to his mage (Allies, Clone), the game then moves to the turn of the next character. Otherwise the game moves to the next player who can be an opponent or teammate.

## Full turn

When a card description mentions a full turn, it means when every player has completed his turn.

## Power Level

The Power Level is the wizard's power represented by an integer. Every wizard has a base Power Level of 1. The Power Level can be used on several occasions. When it serves for a given card, the card description will explain in what manner. It is possible to increase your Powel Level in different ways, the most common being by wearing objects like Rings of Power.

## Saving throw

When you are on the receiving end of an attack, you can usually play a counterattack (C-A) card . If you don't have a C-A card or don't wish to use one, you may be entitled to a Saving throw. In the original game, the saving throw is made with a 20 sided die (d20). A result of 10 or less indicates you dodge the attack / you're not affected by it. A result of 11 or more means you are.

A successful attack can cause damage, resulting in a loss of Hit Points equal to the damage took. Otherwise, the consequence may be the loss of an object, or some other effect depending on the attack card. If the result of the saving throw is 20, it means a critical failure, double damage will be dealt.

## Damage and Hit Points

Cards that cause damage often contain a description under this form:

    Damage: 1-6 · Power Level

This means damage will range from 1 to 6 (randomly) as many times as the attacker's Power Level. So, if the attacker has a Power Level of 3, damage points will be between 3 and 18.

If the description is rather under this form:

    Damage: 1-6 · Power Level

This means damage will range from 1 to 6 (randomly) multiplied by the attacker's Power Level. So, if the attacker has a Power Level of 3, damage points can either be 3, 6, 8, 12, 15 or 18.

The same applies to Attribute cards (A) that provide Hit Points.

## Using the opponent's Power Level or Total Power Level

Some cards use the Power Level of an opponent or the total Power Level that is to say all players involved in the game. In these cases, only the base (1) and the bonus provided by the Rings count. Other items (Hats, Belts, etc.) specify that they are only for the mage playing the card.
